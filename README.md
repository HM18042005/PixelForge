# PixelForge
PixelForge is a fully offline, locally executed AI image-generation system built using Stable Diffusion 1.5 as the base model. Unlike cloud-based AI generators that rely on external APIs, PixelForge performs all model inference directly on the user’s machine using a Python backend and a Next.js/React frontend. This ensures fast generation, privacy preservation, and complete independence from cloud services. The system offers full control over generation parameters such as resolution, CFG scale, inference steps, seed value, negative prompts, and more. PixelForge is suitable for creative users, students, researchers, and developers who need a customizable and fully local generative AI platform. PixelForge also supports LoRA-based fine-tuning using images sourced from the Open Images V7 dataset, incrementally trained across semantic categories such as Person, Indoor, Outdoor, Product, Food, Animal, Vehicle, Architecture, and Landscape. Captioning for dataset images is automated using BLIP, ensuring high-quality text–image pairs for fine-tuning.
